# CrossyRoad
This is a simple educational openGL project that looks similar to Crossyroad game (with some differences).

## How it works?
* Open the project using and C++ IDE (xCode preferred).
* Modify the paths of the resources (Shaders, Sounds, Models, ...etc) in `main.cpp`
* Run the project
* Enjoy!

## How to play?
* Use the arrows to move the penguin.
* Avoid being hit by any moving vehicle.
* Try to reach safe lanes to have a rest :D
* Collect gems as much as as you can.

## What are the required libraries for the project to run?
* irrKlang
* Freetype 6
* Assimp 3.3.1
* SOIL
* GLFW 3.2
* GLEW 2.0.0
* OpenGL framework

## Auto-run!!
To enable auto run (The penguin plays on its own):
Set the 2nd parameter of `AutoRun` class constructor to `true` in main.cpp:57

#### Note
The functionalitiy of auto run isn't working in a stable manner (Latest modification made it even worse), but if you like give it a try
